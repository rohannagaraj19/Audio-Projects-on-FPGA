# Audio Processing on FPGA

This repository showcases two approaches for working with audio signals on FPGA platforms. It includes both software-accelerated audio manipulation (using Vitis and C code) as well as a pure hardware-based method defined entirely within Vivado.

## Overview

- **`audio_top/`**: Contains a project framework that integrates audio processing logic with Vitis. Here, you can write and run C code to manipulate audio streams on your FPGA. This approach allows for more rapid development and testing since changes can be made quickly at the software level before synthesizing the hardware.

- **`hardware_only_audio/`**: Provides a Vivado hardware design template without any associated Vitis workspace. This directory serves as a starting point for implementing audio processing directly in hardware. Itâ€™s well-suited for experimenting with fixed frequency arrays and other DSP elements purely within the FPGA fabric, without relying on software.

## Directory Structure

**`audio_top/`**  
- **Purpose**: Audio manipulation in Vitis.  
- **Key Files**:  
  - `src/` : C source files for audio processing algorithms.  
  - `platform/` : Hardware platform files generated by Vivado.  
  - `Makefile` / `build scripts` : Scripts to build and deploy the project via Vitis.

**`hardware_only_audio/`**  
- **Purpose**: Pure hardware design for audio processing.  
- **Key Files**:  
  - `vivado_project/` : Base Vivado project files.  
  - `design_sources/` : HDL source files for implementing frequency arrays and other hardware-level audio processing elements.  
  - `constraints/` : XDC files for pin assignments and timing constraints.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - **Vivado** (for hardware design)  
   - **Vitis** (optional, if working with the `audio_top` approach)  
   - FPGA development board compatible with the provided project (e.g., Zynq-based board)

2. **Cloning the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohannagaraj19/Audio-Projects-on-FPGA.git
   cd Audio-Projects-on-FPGA
